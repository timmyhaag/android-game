# Basic Android Game
A project that Godwin Bime, Jacob Kessinger, Mangsa Pheudin, Camden Morgan, and I took a part of. The project involves building a simple game for Android that incorporates a Google Play leaderboard. The game will have a game board with 4 columns and 5 rows. Enemy tiles will be randomly generated and come downward. If the tile hits the bottom, the player loses. The player can fight the tiles by dragging player tiles from a "table" nearby. The tiles will have different effects once an enemy tile collides with them.
